Geocomplexity explains spatial errorðŸŒ  (https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2023.2203212)

First author: Myself, Corresponding author: Dr. Yongze SongðŸ—ž

This is my first play with 'Spatial Weights Matrix' using 'spdep' and 'spatialreg' packages in R programming. I used intermediate results from the spatial autoregressive processes to define and quantify a pattern of complexity via spatial dependence. 

Q: What is Geocomplexity?

A: Geocomplexity = local spatial autocorrelation (LISA) + the differences between the local's neighbors

Q: What's the code here?

A: Basic computation of geocomplexity using 'spdep' and 'spatialreg'

Results: The variation of geocomplexity can explain more residuals from linear regression and ML methods than other local spatial indicators. 

ðŸ˜ˆLimits: I cannot 100% guarantee the success of geocomplexity in explaining models' residuals for all cases. However, we are providing new spatial thinking that the interaction among our geographic neighbors may also be important.
